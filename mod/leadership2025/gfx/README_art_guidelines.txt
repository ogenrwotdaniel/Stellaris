# Cosmic Archive Art Asset Guidelines

## Deposit Art Assets (icons/deposits/)
- d_cosmic_archive.dds: A luminous crystalline structure with data-like patterns, blue/cyan color palette, emitting subtle light. Should appear distinctly alien yet technological.
- d_cosmic_archive_remnants.dds: The same structure but dimmed, fractured, with parts missing and energy patterns fading.
- d_cosmic_archive_dormant.dds: The archive structure encased in containment field, power subdued but stable.
- d_cosmic_archive_damaged.dds: Heavily damaged version with chaotic energy patterns, cracks emitting unstable light.

## Guardian Entity (models/ships/guardians/)
- cosmic_archive_guardian.dds: An imposing crystalline entity made of geometric shapes that shift and reconfigure. Should feel vastly advanced but not entirely material - a being of energy and data as much as matter.
- cosmic_archive_guardian_field.dds: Energy field animation (4 frames) showing protective barrier with data patterns flowing through it.
- cosmic_archive_guardian_weapon.dds: Energy weapon animation (6 frames) showing data-like patterns coalescing into beam weapons.

## Event Pictures (event_pictures/)
- cosmic_archive_discovery.dds: Scientists examining the archive structure for the first time, showing wonder and intrigue.
- cosmic_archive_first_signal.dds: Close-up of pulsing archive with researchers monitoring equipment showing unusual readings.
- cosmic_archive_protocols.dds: Holographic interfaces emerging from archive, complex data patterns visible.
- cosmic_archive_activation_safe.dds: Controlled archive activation with stable energy patterns.
- cosmic_archive_activation_risky.dds: More chaotic activation with unstable energy surges.
- cosmic_archive_malfunction.dds: Systems failing, emergency protocols in place.
- cosmic_archive_pulse.dds: Archive emitting powerful pulse affecting surrounding environment.
- cosmic_archive_echoes.dds: Subtle patterns appearing across different systems/planets, suggesting archive influence.
- cosmic_archive_guardian_awakening.dds: Dramatic transformation of archive structure revealing the guardian entity.
- cosmic_archive_guardian_test.dds: Guardian entity presenting challenges through holographic displays.
- cosmic_archive_guardian_military.dds: Guardian entity in combat stance, protective barriers active.
- cosmic_archive_guardian_diplomatic.dds: Guardian entity in communication mode, displaying symbolic patterns.
- cosmic_archive_military_victory.dds: Defeated guardian dissipating into energy that infuses fleet/technology.
- cosmic_archive_diplomatic_success.dds: Guardian entity integrating peacefully with empire systems.
- cosmic_archive_dreams.dds: Citizens experiencing shared visions showing archive-related symbols.
- cosmic_archive_final_warning.dds: Dramatic warning message appearing across empire systems.

## Style Guidelines
- Color palette should focus on blues, cyans, and purples for the Archives
- Guardian entity should incorporate geometric shapes with golden/amber highlights
- All Archive and Guardian visuals should have a distinct data-pattern motif that sets them apart from other Stellaris entities
- Events should convey a sense of mystery, ancient power, and otherworldly intelligence
